            <p>I have adopted the approach that supporting people in the form of coaching and mentoring is possible in
                three different ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Topics related to personality</b>
                    <p>How to use time better? Do I have the right job? How to establish yourself? How to increase
                        self-confidence? How to become a better leader? How to motivate yourself better / more? How to
                        balance work and free time?</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Topics related to a project or task or activity</b>
                    <p>Usually some kind of development project where the expected result is in place. For example, how
                        to grow a company 10x bigger? How to implement strategic HR management? How to create a good
                        culture in an organization?</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Topics related to the position or role</b>
                    <p>Mostly associated with people who have been in the same role for some time and have moved over
                        time to a position where "they don't know what they don't know". For example, what are the
                        industry trends,
                        <i>best
                            practice</i>
                        or something like that. The goal here is to move towards something bigger, better, more
                        suitable, etc., find different connections and learn. For leaders who use a coaching style of
                        leadership, they often have one of the most challenging tasks in their team to support people
                        who need to develop professionally, but who themselves are not aware of it. It doesn't make
                        sense for a manager to just go to someone and say I think your horizons are too narrow.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you feel that I could be a suitable conversation partner for you, please let me know. I will support
                you in your challenges. My goal is to find ways, methods and techniques to maximize your
                self-confidence.</p>
